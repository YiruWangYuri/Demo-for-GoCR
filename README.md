# Globally Optimal Linear Model Fitting with Unit-Norm Constraint

About 
===============
 
Robustly fitting a linear model from outlier-contaminated data is an important and basic task in many scientific fields, and it is often tackled by consensus set maximization. We develop a globally optimal algorithm aiming at consensus set maximization to solve robust linear model fitting problem with the **unit-norm constraint**, which is based on the branch-and-bound optimization framework. The use of unit-norm constraint can eliminate the scale ambiguity of the model parameters and avoid the user-specified initial searching space. We propose a compact representation of the unit-bounded searching domain to avoid introducing additional non-linearity that is intractable for many other globally optimal methods. The compact representation leads to a geometrically derived bound, which accelerates the calculation and enables the method to handle the problems with large number of observations.
